# Ubuntu-Autoinstall

This is a repo that contains a basic Ubuntu-Desktop Autoinstall config for Ubuntu Desktop use and an Express server to statically generate it.

In order to use it, you need a valid .env file with a variable containing the password for the desktop config (which will get hashed)

# How to use :

Simply start the program and when in the Ubuntu autoinstall, link to the express server that is currently running like so : `http://your.ip.address.here:3000/desktop-config`
